## Prerequisites

- [Node v8.10.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/)
- ~~[MySQL 5.7](https://www.mysql.com/)~~
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Usage

If deployed with MySQL, see [this branch](https://github.com/ytjchan/my-simple-postboard/tree/master).

### ~~Installation~~

### ~~Execution~~

### âœ” Deployment

Since it's set to deploy on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), installation of node modules can be done automatically.

To deploy, create a new app on Heroku. Then connect [Heroku Postgres database](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) to the app. Connect to the database using `psql` and create a table using the line in [setup-pg.sql](./setup-pg.sql).

Lastly add the app's repository to your git remote and push there. _Voila!_ The app detects the [Procfile](./Procfile) and deploys it automatically, thanks Heroku!
